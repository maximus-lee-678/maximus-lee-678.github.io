        🎶 In my free time, I like to build up and listen to my personal music catalogue. Being a fan of an older time period, I enjoy rock, R&B, pop and
        synth-pop. I also enjoy listening to Video Game Music (VGM) when studying or working. Some games have really good scores, for example
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221001/FTL_Faster_Than_Light__Soundtrack/" target="_blank">Faster Than Light</a>,
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/268090/Starbound__Soundtrack/" target="_blank">Starbound</a> or
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJaKbPlXXQon3TLMKh_Gm3rSKwPV9dm4w" target="_blank">Hearthstone</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        🎶 In addition to the aforementioned songs of the 80s, I'm also a big fan of the synths behind some of them. It's a whole genre of its own:
        Retro-inspired electronic; including, but not limited to, synthwave, retrowave, darksynth and synthpop. It all began back in Polytechnic, when I
        stumbled across
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg" target="_blank">Kung Fury</a>, an 80s parody by LaserUnicorns. I was hooked by the score, drawn to
        its vibrance & flashiness. Ever since, this genre has been my one-size fits all for any situation.

    <!-- <p>Some of my top picks can be found in my "<a href="music.html">Favourite Music</a>" section.</p> -->
    <p>
        🎮 I also enjoy playing video games. Doesn't mean im good at them though... Nowadays, I can only really find the time to play
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, but there are many other games I recommend. Games
        such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>🏯 <b>Sandbox</b> - <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a></li>
        <li>🔄 <b>Roguelike</b> - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/" target="_blank">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></li>
        <li>👨‍🌾 <b>Farming Sim</b> - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a></li>
        <li>🏹 <b>Action Adventure</b> - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/" target="_blank">Terraria</a></li>

        I'm terrible at art, be it visual or musical. However, I've always wanted to create something I can call my own. I was introduced to my first
        programming language (C++ in Polytechnic), and the rest is history.
    </p>
    <p>
        My toolbelt consists of C, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, PHP and JavaScript. Some of my projects and utilities, either solo or cooperative, can be
        found in the "<a href="projects.html">Projects</a>" section. A pattern you may observe is most (ok, all) of my personal utility programs are written in
        C. Although I may not be the best at it, I enjoy what it has to offer, namely the pointers and "low" level memory management. Beware the triple pointer!
    </p>
    <p>
        There was even that one time I wrote a
        <a href="https://github.com/maximus-lee-678/GlassdoorOpener" target="_blank">web scraper</a> using C and the CURL library. Many argue C's not the right
        tool for the job, and I would be better off using something like Python, and I agree. But where's the fun in that?
        <!-- Some C utilities I've written over the years can be found in the "<a href="c.html">C Corner</a>". -->

    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        In the earlier days of the internet, there existed many static webpages created by many individuals, the likes of which can still be found on
        <a href="https://neocities.org/browse" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, for example. Some have really cozy vibes, others ooze aesthetic, and a few show
        off their technical prowess. Seeing the creativity and expression of others inspired me to create my own little corner on the internet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Much like my music tastes, I also love the 80s retro aesthetic. The website needs to have neon lights, gridlines, setting sun, the whole lot!
    </p>
    <p>This website was written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with jQuery. Mobile view's still in its infancy, stay tuned!</p>
