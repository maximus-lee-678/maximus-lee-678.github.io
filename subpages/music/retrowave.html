        The synth. Capable of invoking many emotions; be it the chill vibes of a late night commute, motivating chords to keep you going during a run, pounding
        notes of a high speed chase or deep space combat, or tracks that make you feel like the Chosen One, this playlist has it all, baby! The tracks of
        differing paces meld together to provide a balanced listening experience suitable for any situation.
