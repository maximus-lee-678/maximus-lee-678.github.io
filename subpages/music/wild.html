        Finally, we have the "wild" playlist. This is a strange one. The only trend in this one is the BPM (Beats per minute). Most, if not all of the songs are
        fast-paced electronic! We got all kinds here, from dubstep, eurobeat, and most importantly, fast paced VGM!

    <p>Just as the title suggests, to listen is to let yourself loose, and to embrace the dissonance!</p>
    <p>Have a listen to some of the dominating albums in this playlist. Maybe you'll find a new favourite hype song!</p>
