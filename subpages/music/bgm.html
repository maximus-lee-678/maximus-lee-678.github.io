        I'm tellin' you, don't sleep on video games when looking for non-distracting musical options. Background music in games is designed to not distract the
        player from whatever it is they are doing, especially in strategy games where focus is key.
    </p>

        Some games are also just chill in general, for example Stardew Valley, offering soothing music and gameplay. Even in more intense games, music during
        periods of downtime can also be quite relaxing, some extreme examples are Borderlands 2 and Path of Exile!

        Of course, this playlist is not limited only to video game music, although it is true that VGM makes up a large majority of it. Find some of my choice
        picks below!
