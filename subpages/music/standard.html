    <p class="music-foreword">
        Widely regarded as the "normal" playlist, usually called upon if I need to DJ. Contains a mix of songs primarily from the 80s and 90s, along with a few
        songs from the 2010s and 2020s. Also has a few Japanese songs in there; I have absolutely no idea what they're saying, they just sound neat!
    </p>

        Many songs from this time period also feature the up and coming technology of the time, the synthesiser! Even before my delve into retrowave, I've
        already liked the cheeriness of these kinds of songs. I guess they were the precursors!
    </p>
    <p>
        There's also plenty of rock; Survivor, Scorpions and Journey being some of the bigger named bands. Gotta thank my dad for introducing me to these,
        they're great! As for the newer songs, they're either iconic songs from my childhood or newer songs that try to emulate to feel of older songs.

        Below, I've listed 25 of my favourite songs. If the same artist is listed more than once, well, it's because they're just that good! Have a listen,
        there's something for everyone!
